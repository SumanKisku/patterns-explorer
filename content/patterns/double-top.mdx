# **Double Top Pattern: A Key Reversal Signal**

The **Double Top** pattern is a bearish reversal chart pattern that typically forms after an extended uptrend. It signals that the upward momentum is weakening and a potential trend reversal to the downside is likely.

## **Structure of the Double Top**

1. **Two Peaks**: The price rises to a high point, retraces downward, then rises again to a similar level, forming two peaks.
2. **Neckline**: The support level formed between the two peaks. A break below the neckline confirms the pattern.

## **Significance**

- **Bearish Reversal**: The Double Top suggests sellers are gaining control as buyers fail to push the price higher.
- **Entry Point**: Traders often wait for the price to break below the neckline for confirmation before entering short positions.
- **Target**: The expected decline is often equal to the height between the peaks and the neckline.

This pattern is widely used to identify selling opportunities and manage risk in technical analysis.

> **Note:** Always wait price action to confirm the pattern
