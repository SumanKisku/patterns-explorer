# **Descending Triangle Pattern**

The **Descending Triangle** is a bearish continuation pattern that indicates potential downward momentum:  

- **Structure**: It features a flat support line at the bottom and a descending resistance line at the top, reflecting sellers increasingly pressuring prices lower.  
- **Breakout**: A breakout below the support line confirms the pattern and signals the continuation of a downtrend.  
- **Volume**: Trading volume typically decreases during consolidation and spikes upon the breakout.  

This pattern is commonly seen in downtrends and signals market weakness.
