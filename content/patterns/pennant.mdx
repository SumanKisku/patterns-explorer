# **Pennant Pattern**

The **Pennant** is a continuation pattern that signals a brief consolidation before the prevailing trend resumes:  

- **Structure**: It resembles a small symmetrical triangle, with converging trendlines forming after a strong price movement (the "flagpole").  
- **Bullish Pennant**: Forms after an upward move; a breakout above the upper trendline suggests the uptrend will continue.  
- **Bearish Pennant**: Forms after a downward move; a breakout below the lower trendline indicates the downtrend will persist.  

Pennants highlight a short pause in the market before momentum picks up in the original direction.
