# **Ascending and Descending Triangle Patterns**

The **Ascending Triangle** and **Descending Triangle** are continuation patterns that indicate potential breakouts:  

1. **Ascending Triangle**: This bullish pattern forms with a flat resistance line and rising support. A breakout above the resistance suggests the uptrend will continue.  

2. **Descending Triangle**: A bearish pattern, it features a flat support line and falling resistance. A breakout below the support signals the downtrend is likely to resume.  

These patterns highlight price consolidation before the prevailing trend typically resumes.
