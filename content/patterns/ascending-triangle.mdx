# **Ascending Triangle Pattern**

The **Ascending Triangle** is a bullish continuation pattern that signals potential upward momentum:

- **Structure**: It has a flat resistance line at the top and a rising support line at the bottom, showing buyers gradually pushing prices higher.  
- **Breakout**: A breakout above the resistance line confirms the pattern and indicates the continuation of an uptrend.  
- **Volume**: Typically, trading volume decreases during the consolidation phase and increases upon the breakout.  

This pattern often forms during an uptrend and is a key indicator of market strength.
