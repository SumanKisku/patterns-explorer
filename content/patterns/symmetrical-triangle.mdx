# **Symmetrical Triangle Pattern**

The **Symmetrical Triangle** is a neutral chart pattern that signals consolidation before a potential breakout:  

- **Structure**: The pattern forms as the price creates lower highs and higher lows, converging into a triangle shape.  
- **Breakout Direction**: A breakout above the upper trendline suggests a bullish continuation, while a breakout below the lower trendline signals a bearish move.  

This pattern reflects market indecision, with the breakout direction determining the next trend.
