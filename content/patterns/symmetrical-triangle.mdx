# **Symmetrical Triangle Pattern**

The **Symmetrical Triangle** is a neutral chart pattern that represents a phase of market consolidation before a potential breakout.  

- **Structure**: The price forms lower highs and higher lows, creating converging trendlines that resemble a triangle.  
- **Breakout Direction**: The breakout can occur in up or down either direction. A breakout above the upper trendline suggests a bullish move, while a breakout below the lower trendline indicates a bearish trend.  
- **Significance**: This pattern reflects market indecision, with the eventual breakout providing a clue about the next trend direction.  

It is commonly used in technical analysis to anticipate significant price movements.
