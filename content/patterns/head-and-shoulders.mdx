# **Understanding the Head and Shoulders Pattern**

The **Head and Shoulders** is one of the most well-known chart patterns in technical analysis, often used to predict a reversal in a market trend. This pattern typically appears at the end of an uptrend and signals a potential bearish reversal.

## **Structure of the Pattern**

1. **Left Shoulder**: The price rises to a peak, then declines slightly.
2. **Head**: A higher peak follows the left shoulder, forming the "head."
3. **Right Shoulder**: The price rises again but forms a peak lower than the head, roughly equal to the left shoulder.

Below these peaks is the **neckline**, a support level connecting the troughs between the shoulders and the head. A break below the neckline often confirms the reversal.

## **Significance**

When the pattern is completed, it suggests a shift in market sentiment, from bullish to bearish. Traders often use it as a signal to exit long positions or enter short trades.

This reliable pattern is used by traders to anticipate price movements and manage risks in their strategies.
