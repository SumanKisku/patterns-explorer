# **Bullish and Bearish Flag Patterns**

The **Bullish Flag** and **Bearish Flag** are continuation patterns signaling a brief pause before the trend resumes:  

1. **Bullish Flag**: Appears after a strong uptrend, with the price consolidating downward in a rectangular shape or channel. A breakout above the flag's resistance signals the continuation of the uptrend.  

2. **Bearish Flag**: Forms after a sharp downtrend, with the price consolidating upward in a similar channel. A breakout beneath the lower boundary of the flag confirms that the downtrend is likely to continue.

These patterns indicate a temporary market consolidation before the prevailing trend resumes.
