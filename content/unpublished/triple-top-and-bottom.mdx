# **Understanding the Triple Top and Triple Bottom Patterns**

The **Triple Top** and **Triple Bottom** are powerful reversal patterns in technical analysis.  

1. **Triple Top**: This bearish reversal pattern forms after an uptrend and features three peaks at roughly the same price level, showing strong resistance. Once the price breaks below the support line connecting the lows between the peaks, it signals a potential downtrend.  

2. **Triple Bottom**: The bullish counterpart, this pattern appears after a downtrend with three troughs at a similar price level, indicating strong support. A breakout above the resistance line connecting the highs between the troughs often triggers an uptrend.  

Both patterns demonstrate that buyers and sellers are battling for control, but the breakout direction confirms the prevailing trend. These patterns are useful tools for traders to anticipate market reversals.
